# [Cyber Bullying Detection System]
This is a capstone project I completed in the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I developed a Python-based system that identifies and prevents harmful online messages, such as hate speech and threats, to promote safer and more respectful interactions on social media platforms.
