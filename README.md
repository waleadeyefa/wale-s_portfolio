# [Capstone Project 1 Analyzing and Decreasing the Growing Influence of Cyberbullying on Social Media]
This project was completed as part of my final-year capstone for my undergraduate degree in Information Technology at Carleton University. The goal of the project was to address the increasing issue of cyberbullying on social media platforms by designing a proactive system that detects and prevents harmful messages before they are posted.
