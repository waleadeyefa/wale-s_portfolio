# Project 1: Cyber Bullying Detection System
This is a capstone project I completed in the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I developed a Python-based system that identifies and prevents harmful online messages, such as hate speech and threats, to promote safer and more respectful interactions on social media platforms.

## Highlights:

* Technology: Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (LSTM models).
* Focus: Detect and block messages containing hate speech, threats, or mocking.
* Interactivity: Provides real-time feedback to users on flagged messages.

## Core Functionality Code: Harmful Message Detection System ![](detection_system.png)
This script implements the primary functionality of the Cyberbullying Detection System by:

* Loading a Custom Word Bank: Reads a pre-defined set of harmful or offensive words stored in a word_bank.txt file.
* User Input Validation: Accepts user comments and checks them against the word bank to identify potentially harmful content.
* Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback by alerting users to rephrase their comments if harmful words are detected.
